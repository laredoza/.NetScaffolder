# .NetScaffolder

### Simple, highly flexible scaffolding framework based on T4 Scripts

The aim of this project will be to quickly generate a base project from a data model. The initial aim will be to generate a MVC project with datacontexts, ef entities & presentation layer. The next will be to generate a repository layer. These will then later be combined into a Domain Driven application. 

### The data model will be generated by importing data from the following sources:

- Edmx Files
- MSSql Metadata
- Oracle Metadata
- Extendable Custom sources

This imported data will then be saved in a xml file (.mdl). All generation will then be based on this file.
This project file will contain domains. A domain will contain several tables ( These are imported from the data sources ). These tables are used to generate the different layers. i.e) Security Domain with a user table and a role table, etc.

T4 templates will be used to generate the different layers. Packages consist of several templates. A domain will be set to use a package to generate all it's layers.  

### Generated Project Types:

- MVC (context, ef entity & presentation)
- MVC (context, ef entity, repository & presentation)
- MVC (Domain Driven - ef)
- MVC (context, NHibernate entity & presentation)
- MVC (context, NHibernate entity, repository & presentation)
- MVC (Domain Driven - NHibernate)
